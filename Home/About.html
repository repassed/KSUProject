            <p>
                At 26 years old, I have valuable life experiences and have traveled the country, 
                as well as visited other nations such as Canada, The United Kingdom, and France. 
                I have served four years in the United States Air Force as a RADAR Airfield and Weather Systems Technician.
                Previously CPR certified and climbing certified, multiple experiences with multi-million dollar military assets for identifying aircraft and weather phenomena. <br>
                I have constantly honed my skills inside the military and other employment experiences as well as outside, 
                developing hobbies to progress my pursuit of knowledge, recently involved in understanding the components of computers and 3d printers.<br>
                Aspirations of mine include the desire to graduate from Kennesaw State University with a degree in Computer Science, as well as working within the same field as my father before me.
                His passion for computers has led me to be constantly intrigued by the wonders of the digital world. As it is an ever expanding horizon to be developed and explored.
